    - https://github.com/apache/lucene/pull/13033: PointRangeQuery now exits earlier on segments whose values don't intersect with the query range. When a PointRangeQuery is a required clause of a boolean query, this helps save work on other required clauses of the same boolean query.
    - https://github.com/apache/lucene/pull/13026: Propagate minimum competitive score in ReqOptSumScorer.
